# spotify_clean_clone

In this example, i'll try to make a better version of Shotgun technical case.

The initial version was released as a proof of work, while the expected outcome was to have an almost finished and clean version.
At the time of doing, most of the time was spent trying to figure out how Apollo Client can work as a State aware Cache intermediary :
However, after several headaches, i couldn't find a serious / efficient approache of handeling this case with Apollo Client v2.

# Comparaison of approches

- Do it yourself instead of using on the shelf tools.
- Atomicity in commits instead of bulk milestones.
